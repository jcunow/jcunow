### 50/1 Challenge - fifty experiments in one year

> - **week 01:** Additive effects of snow cover and lichens on soil microclimatic conditions. Both share similar effects on the thermal regime, but insulation faces diminishing return. Are lichens more important whith less snow?

> - **week 02:** Does plastic reduce available soil volume? Add plastic of varying size to a control with only soil, one with similar particale sized stones. Perhpas, a drought/intense precipitation event treatment too. Lower plant performance expected from plastic mixtures.

> - **week 03:** Aggregation behavior of deer Dama dama in winter. Tag individuals with gps and take DNA samples. Employ graph network methods to model aggregation and diaggregation behavior to find out whether kinship matters, whether landscape heterogeneity matters for aggregation (i.e., specific places where the aggregate and disaggregate)

> - **week 04:** Do solitary burrowing pollinators Promoter microbial Invasion with range Expansion of their host plants due to climate change or Land use practice


> - **week 05:** Does soil health (e.g., Aggregate stability) and farming practice (e.g., crop cover) Limit microbial colonization potential via soil erosion mechanisms (wind/water)
