### 50/1 Challenge - fifty project ideas in one year

> - **week 01:** Additive effects of snow cover and lichens on soil microclimatic conditions. Both share similar effects on the thermal regime, but insulation faces diminishing return. Are lichens more important whith less snow?

> - **week 02:** Does plastic reduce available soil volume? Add plastic of varying size to a control with only soil, one with similar particale sized stones. Perhpas, a drought/intense precipitation event treatment too. Lower plant performance expected from plastic mixtures.

> - **week 03:** Aggregation behavior of deer Dama dama in winter. Tag individuals with gps and take DNA samples. Employ graph network methods to model aggregation and diaggregation behavior to find out whether kinship matters, whether landscape heterogeneity matters for aggregation (i.e., specific places where the aggregate and disaggregate)

> - **week 04:** Do solitary burrowing pollinators Promoter microbial Invasion with range Expansion of their host plants due to climate change or Land use practice

> - **week 05:** Does soil health (e.g., Aggregate stability) and farming practice (e.g., crop cover) Limit microbial colonization potential via soil erosion mechanisms (wind/water)

> - **week 06:** Capture diurnal variation in root exudates and resupply them to soil at differing soil temperature and moisture conditions. Exudation composition and quantity should be assessed. Using isotope labeling, we can try to further trace the origin of the exudation/time lag. Supplying it to varying soil conditions sheds light on soil conditions crerated by grazers such as reindeer.

> - **week 07:** Test the methodological bias of scanning resolution on root tip density. One dataset with a range of original scanning resolution within a System of similar functional plant types. another dataset in which the original resolution is down and upsampled to increased or decrease resolution.

> - **week 08:** Dead plant tissue can perform functions for living organisms. In woody plants, dead stems support structural integrity. Do dead roots perform functions for living plants. An exploration project for potnetial mechanisms. Potential functions: structural integrity, preferential flow path of water, water holding capacity, nucleus for microbial processes i.e., microbe cultivation

> - **week 09:** Within belowground competition among plant species, is there a benefit of activly accerlating root death of dmaged roots to limit resource distribution to pathogens and create a more dangerous environment for plants who do worse  - "living in a hostile world belowground". This requires to track roots dying process and understand it as a progressive ceas√© of function. Just asa any other organism, we can have sudden death - or aging. Methodology pending.
