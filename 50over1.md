### 50/1 Challenge - fifty project ideas in one year

> - **week 01:** Additive effects of snow cover and lichens on soil microclimatic conditions. Both share similar effects on the thermal regime, but insulation faces diminishing return. Are lichens more important whith less snow?

> - **week 02:** Does plastic reduce available soil volume? Add plastic of varying size to a control with only soil, one with similar particale sized stones. Perhpas, a drought/intense precipitation event treatment too. Lower plant performance expected from plastic mixtures.

> - **week 03:** Aggregation behavior of deer Dama dama in winter. Tag individuals with gps and take DNA samples. Employ graph network methods to model aggregation and diaggregation behavior to find out whether kinship matters, whether landscape heterogeneity matters for aggregation (i.e., specific places where the aggregate and disaggregate)

> - **week 04:** Do solitary burrowing pollinators Promoter microbial Invasion with range Expansion of their host plants due to climate change or Land use practice

> - **week 05:** Does soil health (e.g., Aggregate stability) and farming practice (e.g., crop cover) Limit microbial colonization potential via soil erosion mechanisms (wind/water)

> - **week 06:** Capture diurnal variation in root exudates and resupply them to soil at differing soil temperature and moisture conditions. Exudation composition and quantity should be assessed. Using isotope labeling, we can try to further trace the origin of the exudation/time lag. Supplying it to varying soil conditions sheds light on soil conditions crerated by grazers such as reindeer.

> - **week 07:** Test the methodological bias of scanning resolution on root tip density. One dataset with a range of original scanning resolution within a System of similar functional plant types. another dataset in which the original resolution is down and upsampled to increased or decrease resolution.

> - **week 08:** Dead plant tissue can perform functions for living organisms. In woody plants, dead stems support structural integrity. Do dead roots perform functions for living plants. An exploration project for potnetial mechanisms. Potential functions: structural integrity, preferential flow path of water, water holding capacity, nucleus for microbial processes i.e., microbe cultivation

> - **week 09:** Within belowground competition among plant species, is there a benefit of activly accerlating root death of dmaged roots to limit resource distribution to pathogens and create a more dangerous environment for plants who do worse  - "living in a hostile world belowground". This requires to track roots dying process and understand it as a progressive ceasÃ© of function. Just as any other organism, we can have sudden death - or aging. Methodology pending. 

> - **week 10:** Radial growth phenology of trees from thick fine roots to medium coarse roots along stimmt distance, to thick stems, to first order branches, to endmember branches. New dendrometer make it possible. Besides, this let's us look at Minute by Minute water swelling and shrinkages dynamics.

>- **week 13:** Testing temperature control on aboveground - belowground growth phenology synchronicity. If temperature limits growth, geothermal soils should show earlier growth onset belowground compared to no soil warming. Isntall minirhizotrons on Iceland on a soil temperature gradient and collecting root scans & measure aboveground growth (shoot length, phenostages). Potential problem, soil temperatur control on aboveground phenology if e.g., the budbank is at the soil surface or by directly inflyuencing near surface air temperature. Test for plants with differnt growth forms. The alternative hypothese is that plant growth form controls synchronicity more than temperature.

>- **week 13:**  Does ice choke roots in winter and suffocate soil gas transport? When ice forms it expands. In wetlands, this might tranlate into squishy aerenchymatic roots being constricted. This might be relevant to estimate the influence of differnt plant types on winter gas fluxes from peatlands in cold ecosystems. Does the aerenchymatic space stay gas filled? Does th space get smaller? Perhaps as an extension - does that predict whether the root will remain alive next spring? Using containers that can be scanned (x-rays?, other tomographic methods?), a scan after root growth has ceased but unfrozen, one follow-up after a freezing (maybe two freezing treatments:  one slow freezing with temperature cycles, and one fast freezing) on frozen peat, and one follow-up after the thaw. The question remains how to see which one of those died afterwards and which one continue to be active.

>- **week 14:** Literature review & folllow-up: how large is the root scape? What do we know about the sphere of influence of roots? Presumably, the rootscape does not equal the rhizosphere. For example, diurnal water uptake creates pressure gradients in the soil exceeding the immediate influence of the roots. Is the presence of roots and the abundance of roots the best predictor of a root function? Conceivably, the location of a root with respect to the plant aboveground-belowground nexus might matter. We know this from shoots aboveground where the location of buds determines how much resources they will be supplied with. Further, temporal aspects needs to be considered in the size of the rhizosphere. THe imediate influence and historic contigency differs:  abigger sphere of influence over time.   

>- **week 15:** Compare Root-Water Uptake estimates between root dendrometer, diurnal soil water fluctuations, sap flow, and isotop mass balance. The tricky part is to convert the fluxes into comparable units. 

>- **week 16:** get to the bottom of the Root growth limitation debate. In dry ecosystems, moisture can be limiting. Under nebulous circumstances, nutrients  can be limiting. In cold systems, temperature and photosynthetic availability have been proposed. Let's test test soil warming versus snowfree for an evergreen and deciduous plant community. Give them either access to light or access to warmth or the combination.
 
>- **week 20** How much methane is oxidized within wetland plants? We know there are plants speceis that fascillitate methane emission - are there root traits that fascillitate methanotrophs and meyhae oxidation? Sampling roots from a community traced to an individual plant. Sample methanotrophs inside the root tissue in the aerenchymatic root space. Find a way to surpress oxidation (CH2F2?) inside the roots to assess oxidation process rates and whether they correspond to methanotroph colonization and plant species / root trait expression. 
 
>- **week 25** Quantifying plastic pollution. Using FTIR, we can identify different types of plastics. Their spectrum is unique enough to maybe use a quantities PCA approach to say how much of a compound is in a sample. Test in pure soils first like quarz sand (beach sand) or high organics like prestige peat. Needs a to establish a calibration curve with known proportion of plastics.

>- **week 25** Looking at priority effects belowground with by using fluorescent mutants in a minirhizotron setup. That way, we can test whether early and late arrival affect root biomass with species accuracy - otherwise nit possible.

>- **week 25** 
Perspectives paper on ecological meaning of novel minirhizotron traits such as deep-drive or root instances, rooting angle homogeneity, root instance area, soil coloration. 

>- **week 25**
Transpiration is definitely important in trees for methane emissions. People have suggested that the root uptake is the largest barrier for methane uptake from anoxic peat in graminoids. We also have some evidence for diurnal fluctuations of methane emissions. Hypothesis: methane uptake depends on transpiration rates. however, methane quickly enters the aerenchyma afterwards and hence the transpiration control is missed. simply manipulate vpd evaporative demand to induce transpiration variations. Time lags need further attention, as well as proposed diurnal oxidazation mechanisms.
