### 50/1 Challenge - fifty project ideas in one year

> - **1) week 01:** Additive effects of snow cover and lichens on soil microclimatic conditions. Both share similar effects on the thermal regime, but insulation faces diminishing return. Are lichens more important whith less snow?

> - **2) week 02:** Does plastic reduce available soil volume? Add plastic of varying size to a control with only soil, one with similar particale sized stones. Perhpas, a drought/intense precipitation event treatment too. Lower plant performance expected from plastic mixtures.

> - **3) week 03:** Aggregation behavior of deer Dama dama in winter. Tag individuals with gps and take DNA samples. Employ graph network methods to model aggregation and diaggregation behavior to find out whether kinship matters, whether landscape heterogeneity matters for aggregation (i.e., specific places where the aggregate and disaggregate)

> - **4) week 04:** Do solitary burrowing pollinators Promoter microbial Invasion with range Expansion of their host plants due to climate change or Land use practice

> - **5) week 05:** Does soil health (e.g., Aggregate stability) and farming practice (e.g., crop cover) Limit microbial colonization potential via soil erosion mechanisms (wind/water)

> - **6) week 06:** Capture diurnal variation in root exudates and resupply them to soil at differing soil temperature and moisture conditions. Exudation composition and quantity should be assessed. Using isotope labeling, we can try to further trace the origin of the exudation/time lag. Supplying it to varying soil conditions sheds light on soil conditions crerated by grazers such as reindeer.

> - **7) week 07:** Test the methodological bias of scanning resolution on root tip density. One dataset with a range of original scanning resolution within a System of similar functional plant types. another dataset in which the original resolution is down and upsampled to increased or decrease resolution.

> - **8) week 08:** Dead plant tissue can perform functions for living organisms. In woody plants, dead stems support structural integrity. Do dead roots perform functions for living plants. An exploration project for potnetial mechanisms. Potential functions: structural integrity, preferential flow path of water, water holding capacity, nucleus for microbial processes i.e., microbe cultivation

> - **9) week 09:** Within belowground competition among plant species, is there a benefit of activly accerlating root death of dmaged roots to limit resource distribution to pathogens and create a more dangerous environment for plants who do worse  - "living in a hostile world belowground". This requires to track roots dying process and understand it as a progressive ceasé of function. Just as any other organism, we can have sudden death - or aging. Methodology pending. 

> - **10) week 10:** Radial growth phenology of trees from thick fine roots to medium coarse roots along stimmt distance, to thick stems, to first order branches, to endmember branches. New dendrometer make it possible. Besides, this let's us look at Minute by Minute water swelling and shrinkages dynamics.

>- **11) week 13:** Testing temperature control on aboveground - belowground growth phenology synchronicity. If temperature limits growth, geothermal soils should show earlier growth onset belowground compared to no soil warming. Isntall minirhizotrons on Iceland on a soil temperature gradient and collecting root scans & measure aboveground growth (shoot length, phenostages). Potential problem, soil temperatur control on aboveground phenology if e.g., the budbank is at the soil surface or by directly inflyuencing near surface air temperature. Test for plants with differnt growth forms. The alternative hypothese is that plant growth form controls synchronicity more than temperature.

>- **12) week 13:**  Does ice choke roots in winter and suffocate soil gas transport? When ice forms it expands. In wetlands, this might tranlate into squishy aerenchymatic roots being constricted. This might be relevant to estimate the influence of differnt plant types on winter gas fluxes from peatlands in cold ecosystems. Does the aerenchymatic space stay gas filled? Does th space get smaller? Perhaps as an extension - does that predict whether the root will remain alive next spring? Using containers that can be scanned (x-rays?, other tomographic methods?), a scan after root growth has ceased but unfrozen, one follow-up after a freezing (maybe two freezing treatments:  one slow freezing with temperature cycles, and one fast freezing) on frozen peat, and one follow-up after the thaw. The question remains how to see which one of those died afterwards and which one continue to be active.

>- **13) week 14:** Literature review & folllow-up: how large is the root scape? What do we know about the sphere of influence of roots? Presumably, the rootscape does not equal the rhizosphere. For example, diurnal water uptake creates pressure gradients in the soil exceeding the immediate influence of the roots. Is the presence of roots and the abundance of roots the best predictor of a root function? Conceivably, the location of a root with respect to the plant aboveground-belowground nexus might matter. We know this from shoots aboveground where the location of buds determines how much resources they will be supplied with. Further, temporal aspects needs to be considered in the size of the rhizosphere. THe imediate influence and historic contigency differs:  abigger sphere of influence over time.   

>- **14) week 15:** Compare Root-Water Uptake estimates between root dendrometer, diurnal soil water fluctuations, sap flow, and isotop mass balance. The tricky part is to convert the fluxes into comparable units. 

>- **15) week 16:** get to the bottom of the Root growth limitation debate. In dry ecosystems, moisture can be limiting. Under nebulous circumstances, nutrients  can be limiting. In cold systems, temperature and photosynthetic availability have been proposed. Let's test test soil warming versus snowfree for an evergreen and deciduous plant community. Give them either access to light or access to warmth or the combination.
 
>- **16) week 20:** How much methane is oxidized within wetland plants? We know there are plants speceis that fascillitate methane emission - are there root traits that fascillitate methanotrophs and meyhae oxidation? Sampling roots from a community traced to an individual plant. Sample methanotrophs inside the root tissue in the aerenchymatic root space. Find a way to surpress oxidation (CH2F2?) inside the roots to assess oxidation process rates and whether they correspond to methanotroph colonization and plant species / root trait expression. 
 
>- **17) week 25:** Quantifying plastic pollution. Using FTIR, we can identify different types of plastics. Their spectrum is unique enough to maybe use a quantities PCA approach to say how much of a compound is in a sample. Test in pure soils first like quarz sand (beach sand) or high organics like prestige peat. Needs a to establish a calibration curve with known proportion of plastics.

>- **18) week 25:** Looking at priority effects belowground with by using fluorescent mutants in a minirhizotron setup. That way, we can test whether early and late arrival affect root biomass with species accuracy - otherwise nit possible.

>- **19) week 25:** Perspectives paper on ecological meaning of novel minirhizotron traits such as deep-drive or root instances, rooting angle homogeneity, root instance area, soil coloration. 

>- **20) week 25:** Transpiration is definitely important in trees for methane emissions. People have suggested that the root uptake is the largest barrier for methane uptake from anoxic peat in graminoids. We also have some evidence for diurnal fluctuations of methane emissions. Hypothesis: methane uptake depends on transpiration rates. however, methane quickly enters the aerenchyma afterwards and hence the transpiration control is missed. simply manipulate vpd evaporative demand to induce transpiration variations. Time lags need further attention, as well as proposed diurnal oxidazation mechanisms.

>- **21) week 25:** A climate gradient from northern scandinavia to central europe (and beyond) to sample ericoid root traits from multiple ericacious species in single-dominant stands - to then assess intra- and interspecies specific root trait variation, how much it varies between them and how responsive each species is to the background climate and soil fertility. Maybe also include the tree species. That would probably elevate it quite a bit and we can make stronger conclusions about the climate response of the ecosystem, of functional groups, of between species, and within species.

>- **22) week 26:** Do insects leave bite marks in leafs in ways to minimize the damage to leaf to keep it running for longer? Do the insects, especially host specific ones and those who need longer to chew on a leaf have a greater need to keep the leaf in a state that is as intact as possible for longer? This would depend on the vein network strucutre of the leaf. Collect leafs with chewing marks from known species, also record the time it takes to create the bite marks. measure the leafs functional performance before and after. Use different insects ont the same plant species. Use differnt plant species with contrasting vein networks. Preferably, the range of insects covers specialists and generalists.

>- **23) week 26:** Where are galls placed on a leaf? Can we find commonalities across splant species with regards of the leaf vein network structure and the ability of the plant to reject the gall part of the leaf by letting the tissue around it die off. Is there a correlation with the size of the gall and the vein network? Reanalyze leafs with galls on them and develop a placement metric related to logistics of optimal supply and minimal invasion - keeping the leaf working as well as possible. 

>- **24) week 26:** Short-term snow removal (6years) versus long-term snow removal (40 years) at Puukkosuo, Oulanka FI. Install minirhizotron tubes at the Palsa Experiment and see whether rootig depth and root growth timing differs between them. Further, use minirhizotrons to estimate groundfrost position. Vegetation composition is already different between those two treatments, but long-term snow removal also uses snow compaction and trampling needs further clarification.

>- **25) week 27:** Going back to the steady state assumption of root production and decomposition. While likley true averared over time or space, why should it be aligned at a given site in given year when controlling mechanisms are not identical? Measure both root production and decomposition at local scale and at distant geographic location with vegeation of similar growth type, to capture spatial heterogeneity in control mechanisms. Method to be determined. Maybe Minirhizotron + soil coring & root litter bags? Look for systematic understimation of methods beforehand. Expected outcome, some locations with lower decomposition vs production, others higher decomposition vs production. The averaged effect in a good sample design is net 0.

>- **26) week 27:** A sap flow dialysis machine that deverts a portion of phloem transported water for analysis. This could be used to assess temporal and compositional changes in carbon loading and transport inside plants. 

>- **27) week 28:** Challenging the assumption that fresh root growth is necessary to perform root functions. What if there is a strategy to deploy roots late in the season to be able to use them the following year after winter? We know basically nothing about temporal rooting strategies in e.g. sedges. If lateral flow of water is flushing nutrients to the root surface, perhaps spring root growth is not as essential. A test could be having water or nitrogen isotope uptake compared between plants with high turnover annual root systems and perennial overwintering roots over time from late winter to summer. Adding lateral water flow in mesocosms to adress local nutrient depletion.

>- **28) week 29:** Quantifying root water uptake rates, compared to passive CH4 diffusion into roots. Next step, model root water uptake in relation to root density at given CH4 pore water concentration. Next step, include lateral flow as supply and local production rates. The question is: is diffusion enough to explain CH4 emissions or do we need to consider the transpiration pathway in non-woody plants too?

>- **29) week 35:** Using Fiber-optic cables to get a temporal and spatial cover of root, stem, and twig radial expansion dynamics. This allows us to track the temporal time lag of water movement through the tree in space. Simply wrap the cable tightly in a spiralling motion around the tree. Mark way points on the cable to calibrate the where which length of the cables is on the tree. From the root to the canopy. Ensure that shadows and exposure dont influnece the measurement (reflective cover?!). This could be highly interesting in systems with defoliation or drought treatments.  

>- **30) week 39:** Integrating non-structural carbohydrates into above-belowground phenology study in sedges. Hypothesis: plants in sloping fens dont share non-structural carbohydrates with roots until fully grown. We need to track the nsc phenology as well. If we account for carbon uptake, and measure shoot length, all remaining carbon should go into respiration or storage. We can try to sample roots to assess root reparation, and get shoot respiration by excluding soil (similar to shoot methane flux measurements). We set up a sequential harvest design from which we can get organs specific respiration. Using the new analysis technique from czechia, we can get nsc amount fairly easily. I expect a shift in NSC ratio between organs once shoot growth stops and root growth starts.

>- **31) week 40:** Reconstructing dispersal areas from intensive sampling. Once genome sequencing for many many samples becomes affordable to distinguish individuals, we can take samples on a dense grid to see how far a lineage got. To make life easy, start with clonal species e.g. a wetland. We could compare the same type of vegetation in wetlands with varying establishment age. Early establishment is expected to have higher germination success and thus a dispersal combination of seed and clone. Later stages are expected to expand their lineage area rather slow. The last stage is expected to have mire patchy lineage areas and the highest spatial entropy. It would be beneficial to use an ecosystem which starts without prior genomic legacy. Perhaps a salt marsh gradient would also work?!

>- **32) week 40:** Exploratory test what determines rhizome longevity, ramet persistence, root lifespan, and shoot life span. What determines a divergence between them? Are the these lifespan interrelated over a common strategy, and to what extent does a ceiling relationship contribute to their correlation? Could be database work, but it'd require descent measurements of multiple variables simultaneously 

>- **33) week 42:** Train a model on hemispherical canopy images throughout seasons to identify species  identity, species canopy contribution, species specific phenology, and mixing entropy of species. Also, twig vs leave area. Pure species annotations are easy against a bright background. leaves and twigs can be separated in rgb. mixed composition requires manual annotations. Images with known species occurrences are plenti available.

>- **34) week 42:** Same as #33 but on phenocam images to derive species specific access phenology. This might need multi/hyperspectral addition for training. The model should be capable of identifying a species accuratly throughout the phenological transitions and yield stats on it.

>- **35) week 46:** Use passive acustic monitoring (soil sound) to observe how responsive earthworms are to drying conditions. A ongoing moderate drought experiment where partial nightly recharge occurs. Do earthworms adapt their dirurnal activity patterns in reponse to drying soil? Is there a threshold/breakpoint/non-linear? Biggest hurdle: making soil sound comparible across soil moisture conditions. Perhaps, we could use a calibration set with not soil fauna, adjusting the moisture and give an external sound stimulus to see how the soil conditions change the sound itself first.

>-  **36) week 49:** Exploring how we can use location-scale model on old datasets to ask new research questions about the variance response of a treatment. Can we rewrite the article with an alternative question in mind if we apply a location-scale model instead. A recycling project.

>- **37) week 50:** remove canopy dead standing biomass/ litter at the very end of the growing season to quantity the effect on snow accumulation, microclimate, on spring phenoligy.

>- **38) week 50:** assess canopy complexity before the winter like litter height distribution. label individual sheets to see how fast the litter travels down and whether thicker snow cover lead to faster soil incorporation

>- **39) week 50:** measure soil virus response curve to temperature in different seasons. maybe there is a temporal niche for them via host switching.

>- **40) week 50:** how much seasonal community turnover do soil viruses and host communities exhibit in Peatlands?

>- **41) week 50:** what is the dispersal rate of microbes in the soil? inoculate sterile soil in a sterile environment with a strain of microbes and sample in spatial-temporal intervals to estimate the velocity of propergation.

>- **42) week 50:** ammend potted plants different types of root herbivores with varying density, and measure the secondary metabolite concentration in the roots (and herbivores). Maybe label the plant with isotopes to confirm whether the root herbivore presence alone, or active feeding triggers a response. check for isotopes in the herbivores later.

>- **43) week 50:** ammend potted soil with phenol/ secondary compound cocktails which mimick various types of root litter. than measure whether it suppresses the successors root growth and soil biota.

>- **44) week 52:** we still have very little idea what controls root phenoligy in perennial plants. Test the influence of demography on root growth onset/ ending. Old rhizomes may not invest in a future root system and preemption of soil but have more storage compounds accumulated to offset belowground growth from shoot growth.

>- **45) week 52:** create a database for secondary defensive metabolites in roots. 

>- **46) week 52:** aboveground,unpalatable plants like e.g., thorny shrubs can facilitate growth of other plants by extension of their self protection. Do we find these mechanisms belowground too? I suspect there is a size dependency between herbivores and defense effectiveness. If certain roots produce defensive metabolites that diffuse in the soil, this might deter root herbivory on other plants as well. There are supposedly examples in gardens. but not so much in natural systems. Testing facilitation. Could this partially explain cooccurance of plants?

>- **47) week 52:** quantify the impact of water isotope enrichment of lichen in boreal forest. Fructose lichen keep the soil longer moist, increase roughness which increases the boundary layer of the soil, high albedo reflects solar short wave radiation. evaporation from the soil is partially reabsorbed by lichens, hence the resident time is much longer. This will affect the H and O isotope signature of plants as the water source shifts - how much? Picarro probe in the soil, in the lichen layer/4cm height, above the lichen layer/15cm height. Do this in a lichen removal experiment. Sample needles from both sites before lichen removal, and needles spanning before and after in both. as well as newly developed needles.

>- **48) week 52:** in reference to (a bit cheating) nr. 16), explicitly test phenological synchronicity of slow versus fast species, including the contrast of perennial and annual plants, and maybe transplants from regions with different climate baseline to mess with their temperature sensitivity. Measure phenology of leaf growth. root growth, transpiration, and nutrient uptake - to see whether growth is even necessary to perform functions.

>- **49) week 53:** highway phenology as a way to assess plant phenology on a subdiurnal scale (including flower openings) with high spatial resolution. something mounted to many car (perhaps inside) that takes periodically he referenced photos from the green stripe close to the street / shrub height. To analyze, create a map where unsuitable regions are masked to retain only suitable vegetation photos. The end product is the green/yellow/red wave. Start small and test upscale potential. Maybe trains are better. We need microclimate assessments at certain points to assess bias that the infrastructure introduces. High spatial & temporal resolution!

>- **50) week 53:** which spatial scale in the soil matters for root? No experimental test. We design an experimental grid with increasing resource patch heterogeneity on one axis, and resource patch size on a second axis. This includes complete homogeneous conditions but varying resources availability. This way, we can test if the resource availability influences root traits generally, as baseline assumption. For the manipulated soil with differently sized, heterogenous to homogeneously distributed resources, we have to sample the root traits separately within and outside of patches. Resource patches need to be containable with little leaching. Love it.

>- **51) bonus material, week 53:** 
Is there a spatial legacy of soil? Let roots grow through one type of soil, and than in another. We want to know whether the first soil influences the root traits in the second part. We can do this horizontally (realism) and vertically (mechanistically). The proper control is crucial here. The temporal component could be very important because,for example, a nutrient poor first soil might simply delay root exploration in the second but not the climax state. work in progress.
